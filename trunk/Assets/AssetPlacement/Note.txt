Asset Placement System is for easily creating and placing assets within the unity editor via hotkeys. 
- Ask Jon for Questions on this.

[Setup]
- Windows/AssetPlacement 
- Set hotkeys in AssetPlacementSystem
- Click 'Reset Assets' button in AssetPlacementSystem to refresh loaded assets.
- Click 'Reset Hotkeys' to generate a new Hotkey file that matches current key choices. //TODO No longer needed?

[Notes]
- Asset selection Hotkeys only work for the currently selected tab
- Reseting the hotkeys will not work right away. 
-- Build and refresh twice, and use buttons in the meantime.

Alt+E Toggle Auto Snap if using AutoGridSnap. //TODO I assume this works
